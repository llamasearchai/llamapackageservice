START OF THE ULTIMATE CODING PROMPT ––––––––––

You are an expert software architect and full-stack developer. Your task is to generate a comprehensive program with a colorful command line interface that is organized in modular components. The program must include the following features and meet all the listed requirements:

OVERARCHING FUNCTIONALITY: • Create an application that performs package processing tasks (inspired by the PackageProcessor trait in the provided context). The core processing logic may include sample "gradient-descent" operations or analogous computational workflows (only if it makes sense in context). • Remove any references or support for advanced scraping, stealth integration, or llama integration—the code should focus solely on the essentially structured processing operations and command line interactions.

PROJECT STRUCTURE: • Organize your code into multiple modules. Each module should reside in its own file within a well-organized project structure (e.g., separate files for the processor trait, error handling, file organization, and command line interface). • Every module should be designed for testability and clarity of purpose.

COMMAND LINE INTERFACE: • The CLI must be colorful and informative. Use ANSI color codes to differentiate between normal messages, warnings, errors, and progress updates. • Include interactive progress bars (e.g., using an indicatif-like library or equivalent) to indicate the status of processing and testing.

AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION & SETUP: • Create a complete shell script "setup.sh" that runs on an M3 Max MacBook Pro (macOS – ensure compatibility with ARM architecture). This script should: - Check and install required system dependencies (e.g., Rust toolchain/cargo, any other system packages). - Install all code dependencies automatically (via Cargo or another package manager as needed). - Build the full project. • The shell script should handle errors gracefully, aborting with a clear error message if a step fails.

AUTOMATED TESTING & MOCK TESTS: • Design automated tests for every module. These tests should do the following: - Execute mock tests immediately after installation. - Use a progress bar to display the test progress, and clearly print "PASSED" for each test when successful. - Run the full suite of tests automatically before the main program runs. - Provide detailed error output if a test fails, ensuring that the overall test process is robust.

FULL CODE GENERATION REQUIREMENTS: • The AI model must generate the complete codebase with all files, including but not limited to: - The core Rust files for each module (e.g., src/processor_trait.rs, src/main.rs, src/error.rs, src/file_organizer.rs, etc.). - The full "setup.sh" shell script for installation and setup. - A fully configured Cargo.toml file with all dependencies. - A separate module (or integrated in the main code) that implements the colorful CLI. - A mock testing framework integrated with progress feedback (tests might use libraries like "indicatif" for progress bars or similar). • All generated code must be production-ready, fully integrated, and include inline comments explaining non-trivial parts for clarity. • Ensure there are no dependencies or external integrations not automatically installable by the setup script.

CODE QUALITY & ERROR HANDLING: • The generated code must be robust and free of errors. Assume that the code will be compiled and executed immediately upon installation. • Instructions for running the program after setup should be clearly included in the shell script. • Provide instructions within the codebase's README (auto-generated as part of the code if possible) outlining how the system works, how tests are conducted, and how the user can view the colorful output from the command line.

FINAL EXECUTION: • After the installation and test phases, the final program should launch and continue to run, providing a clear and interactive console interface that guides the user through its features. • Every fallback error message or unexpected event should be handled gracefully with informative, colorful messages.

Please generate the complete, flawless, and fully integrated code for this project. The shell script and all code must work automatically without errors when executed on an M3 Max MacBook Pro, and the installation process must handle every dependency, module test, and provide a polished, colorful command line interface.

–––––––––– END OF THE ULTIMATE CODING PROMPT ––––––––––

This prompt is designed to help an AI model generate a fully functional, modular, and robust program along with an installation and testing shell script. The resulting code should be production-ready, comprehensive, and easy to execute on a modern macOS machine.
